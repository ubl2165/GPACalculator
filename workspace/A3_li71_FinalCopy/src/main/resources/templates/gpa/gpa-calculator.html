Description: A web application to calculate GPA grade.
1. When the user clicks the GPA calculator on the main index page, calculate 
and display the cumulative GPA for all courses that have final grades 
(assume that a course object/record with "complete" as false is a course that 
has not been completed and therefore does not have a final grade).
also show a table with the term GPAs (a course that is marked as "complete" will 
have the term field set to the term# when it was completed and assigned 
a final grade - for example, a student might not necessarily take syst10199 
in term 2 even though it's a term 2 course, they might take it in term 3, 
so its final grade would affect the term 3 GPA). Another option could be to 
use a form for the user to select whether they want to see the cumulative GPA, 
or a term GPA (for all terms, or perhaps they could select a specific term?) 
Read the Course bean documentation inside the Course class for hints
